# Forecasting-Sales
Using time-series and deep learning models to forecast sales.

## DATA
A timeseries dataset is given in the dataset folder consisting of monthly sales. The sales information spans the duration of 8 years and 9 months. The dataset is composed of two fileds. The first field "Month" shows the dates in yyy-mm format and the second field "Sales" shows the number of products sold in the corresponding year and month.  

## AIM 
The aim of the project is to train models using the first 8 years and using the trained models to predict the amount of sales for the last 9 months. Different models are compared with each other based on the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) calculated on the last 9 months.
